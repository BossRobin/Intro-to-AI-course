Search is an implementation of various graph search algorithms for search trees including BFS, DFS, heuristic driven A* Graph Search.

Multiagent search is an implementation of search tree algorithms used for multiplayer games like Pacman, Tic-Tac-Toe etc. 
Algorithms include MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and ExpectiMax. 

Also designed evaluation functions to evaluate states and state-action pairs used by a Reflex Agent.

Reinforcement is an implementation of various reinforcement learning techniques such as policy iteration, value iteration, Q-Learning and Approximate Q-Learning on Grid World and Pac-man.
