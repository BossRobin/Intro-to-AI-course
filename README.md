Search is an implementation of various graph search algorithms for search trees including BFS, DFS, heuristic driven A* Graph Search.

Multiagent search is an implementation of search tree algorithms used for multiplayer games like Pacman, Tic-Tac-Toe etc. 
Algorithms include MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and ExpectiMax. 

Also designed evaluation functions to evaluate states and state-action pairs used by a Reflex Agent.
